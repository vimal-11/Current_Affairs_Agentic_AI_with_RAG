		<full_content>A federal judge blocked portions of a Trump administration order Friday that would have required voters to show proof of citizenship at the voting booth.

In a 44-page memorandum, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper ordered that adding layers of difficulty to the voting process would only harm eligible voters by adding significant barriers before they can cast their ballots.

Casper further noted that Donald Trump’s order was an executive overreach and that the authority to set new election requirements rests with Congress.

“There is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship,” Casper wrote. “The issue here is whether the president can require documentary proof of citizenship where the authority for election requirements is in the hands of Congress, its statutes … do not require it, and the statutorily created [Election Assistance Commission] is required to go through a notice and comment period and consult with the states before implementing any changes to the federal forms for voter registration.”

One of five provisions in the executive order blocked by Casper mandated that the Election Assistance Commission collect and record information on provided documentary proof of citizenship in the national voter registration form. Casper’s ruling also intervened in a White House decree that ordered the secretary of defense to update the absentee application for overseas voters or Americans in the military, which under Trump’s direction would have required such voters to provide proof of citizenship as well as proof of eligibility to vote in their respective states.

“Neither the Constitution nor any statute grants the president the authority to enact” such an order, the judge wrote.

Since Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies have obsessed over contrived claims of voter fraud—a statistical nonissue in U.S. elections. For instance, a statewide audit out of Georgia, the epicenter of Trump’s baseless theory, revealed in September that just 20 noncitizens out of 8.2 million residents existed on the state’s voter roll. Out of those 20, only nine participated in elections, years ago, before ID was required as a part of the voter verification process. The other 11 individuals were registered but never actually voted, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

Critics argue that restrictions on the front end of the electoral process—such as one-day voting and requiring day-of voter ID, which Trump pledged to apply in December—would minimize voter turnout and limit the democracy’s ability to represent its constituents. This would especially be true in high-density areas like the nation’s biggest cities, where those stipulations would significantly drain resources (i.e., boost the number of volunteers required) and require more time to process, potentially leading to delays.</full_content>

		<full_content>Yves here. Even though Rob Urie is correct to be very worried about the potential for nuclear escalation, he makes a key assumption which I believe leads him to considerably over-estimate the odds of the US (or its Israel attack dog) resorting quickly if at all to that option. Of course, we are led by recklessly stupid people who think using a “tactical” nuke is no biggie.

Yes, it seems to be true that the US cannot destroy all or even most of Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities, underground missile caches and launch silo, and underground factories. Ted Postol has come to the same conclusion as Scott Ritter, cited below.

However, destruction of these facilities is not an objective but a pretext. The objective is regime change. If the Collective West succeeds in that aim, it can simply have its pet new government give access to all these bunkers and let the new masters decide what to do about them.

Indeed, there is a very big argument against destroying these bunkers, even if we could. Iran has a lot of missiles, including hypersonic missiles, a type of weapon the West has yet to put into production. The Collective West is extremely short of missiles. What better way to replenish our kit for the purpose of Project Ukraine and Project Get China than take a big cache from Iran? Recall (and I do not know by what process) that a lot of Syria’s weapons allegedly made their way to Ukraine.

So I am sticking with my early bet: that the real plan is to pound Tehran, as Israel did with Beirut. It was the toll on civilian life and infrastructure that led Hezbollah to back off on its campaign in support of Palestinians. Sure, the US and Israel will also pound on Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan. Even if the Israel plus its NATO friends could destroy them, that would not achieve regime change. Failure to do what is deemed to be sufficient damage could thus justify further attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Another factor to consider in the immediate trajectory is that Western outlets are admitting that Israel is taking body blows from Iran, such as the very-pro Israel Telegraph three days ago in Iran’s high-tech onslaught punches deadly holes in Israel’s air defences. The Washington Post has said that Israel will only be able to intercept Iranian missiles for another 10 to 12 days, not that it is doing all so well even now.

One would think that the evidence that the war has not gone according to US and Israel plans would lead to quick US entry, and not just quick US threat display.

However, US/Israeli self-serving propaganda is leading to official belief in a variant of a familiar narrative, “Iran is just about to run out of missiles. From Larry Johnson:

I am reliably informed by someone with access that Trump and his team believe, based on Israeli intelligence, that Iran is running low on missiles and will soon exhaust their supply. This is utter nonsense. Iran has been building and stockpiling missiles for more than twenty years. These missiles are stored safely underground, out of the reach of Israeli and US bombs.

In other words, the US is likely to be overconfident yet again over what it can achieve via conventional means. I suspect we’ll have to see the US and Israel encounter more cold doses of reality before they decide whether to go the nuclear route.

And a not-quite-as-fast-as-some-fear escalation path increases the odds of Iran play the “closing the Strait of Hormuz” card, which might get Mr. Market to knock some sense into Trump’s head.

By Rob Urie, author of Zen Economics, artist, and musician who publishes The Journal of Belligerent Pontification on Substack

As this essay is being written, military supply ships, aircraft carriers, and refueling aircraft are being sent by the US to West Asia as the US appears ready to formally enter the war that it started with Iran. With nuclear weapons being the only option left for busting Iran’s bunkers (details below), their ‘pragmatic’ use for bunker busting would cross every nuclear red-line that an increasingly resistant world has put forward. Once the nuclear line is crossed, it is a matter of days or weeks until human life on the planet ends. The escalation logic is inexorable.

Despite press assurances in the West that the attack on Iran is an Israeli affair, the fingerprints of the US can be found all over the plot. As the initial attack was ongoing, the US Navy attempted to shoot down Iranian missiles as Iraq, under the control of the US, closed its airspace to Iranian fighter jets. Donald Trump’s claim that ‘he knew everything’ is because the US is uniquely responsible for the attack. At this point, claims that ‘it was Israel’ are quaint.

Graph: Over recent decades, Israel has been the largest recipient of US foreign aid by a significant measure, with most of it aid being used to buy weapons and materiel. Lest this remains a mystery, the US gives Israel money to buy weapons from the US, and Israel does so. In other words, the US launders payments to private military producers by running them through Isreal. Source: Council on Foreign Relations.

Scott Ritter offered that the US has already deployed its largest conventional bunker buster, the thirty-ton air-fuel bomb, which failed in Yemen against less deeply buried bunkers. This leaves the US with nuclear weapons as the only escalatory step available. However, nuclear weapons represent a boundary which once crossed, can’t be uncrossed. The Russians have promised no first strike. But they have also warned that once the boundary is crossed, they will respond in kind.

Remarkably, the list of nations in West Asia that have been unilaterally attacked by the US since 2003 matches both the list of nations in line for US regime change operations leaked by retired US General Wesley Clark in 2003, as well as most of the nations that form the Zionist fantasy of Greater Israel. Given that Donald Trump was not in the government in 2003, the current US policy was set in motion twenty-two years ago.

This last point requires further explanation. The reason why Donald Trump’s foreign policy so closely resembles Joe Biden’s foreign policy is because presidents don’t decide US foreign policy. Consider, the attacks on both Iran and Russia were conceived and put into action at some time prior to the present. The scuttlebutt in the establishment press keeps landing on eighteen months ago. Joe Biden was president eighteen months ago, not Trump.

Logically, the Western attack on Iran required 1) a will to attack and 2) the capacity to attack. Neither alone would motivate the act. Will without capacity lacks capacity. And capacity without will lacks will. Israel possesses will but not capacity. And the US supplies the capacity with full understanding of what it will be used for. This makes the US a participant in Israel’s actions. American prosecutors regularly prosecute those who provide criminals with the weapons they use in their crimes.

Ominously, it was the US that cancelled the sixth meeting between the West and Russia to discuss peace in Ukraine. The cancellation followed a reported enthusiastic phone call from V. Putin to Donald Trump. Mr. Putin undoubtedly detected a mismatch between what Mr. Trump is saying and the facts as they can be determined. More to the point, the Western effort to assassinate Mr. Putin while attacking Russian nuclear assets looks very much like the current Western effort to decapitate the Iranian regime with its attack on Iran.

Despite the tone of the phone exchange, Mr. Putin is reported to have offered to mediate between Israel and Iran, and Mr. Trump is reported to have been open to the suggestion. That this is taking place as the US is moving military personnel and equipment into place in what is increasingly looking like the launch of an American war across West Asia, suggests that Mr. Trump is saying one thing while doing another.

According to the informed speculation in the US, the initial attack on Iran was intended to produce a result akin to the dissolution of Syria. Decapitation strikes were supposed to break Iran’s will to fight as US bombs destroyed what is alleged to be Iran’s ‘nuclear program.’ With the decapitation effort ongoing, the West hasn’t yet been thwarted. But Iranian missiles landing in Tel Aviv wasn’t supposed to happen. As it currently stands, Iran can land hypersonic missiles inside Israel at will.

The pretense that Donald Trump is being sandbagged by neocons into prosecuting wars that he doesn’t want is wearing thin. His ‘tweets,’ or whatever one calls the technology this week, that proclaimed his role in the airstrikes launched against Iran, suggest that he is in junior high school, a boy, likely American, and is desperate for recognition from his fellow humans. What they didn’t suggest is that he understands the power that he wields to destroy human existence.

Where this lands with respect to Iran is that Russia has lots of business with Iran, it has a soft defense agreement with Iran, and unless the Russians have suddenly ‘gone American,’ Russia understands that the US is coming for Russia if it (US) prevails in Iran. Mr. Trump has demonstrated that he is a willing foot soldier in the Western imperial project. The strategic inflexibility that this program implies will end the world.

To the US – Israeli claim that Iran must end its nuclear weapons program, the US intelligence services have repeatedly stated that such a program does not exist, Meanwhile, Israel is known to possess 75 – 300 nuclear weapons that have never been declared, and are therefore illegal. The point is that the US has no ideological or moral qualms regarding the possession of nuclear weapons. Differences emerge over who it is that possesses them.

With the wars in Ukraine and West Asia now merging, the economic basis of the conflict is being revealed. The US is trying to destroy BRICS ( B razil, R ussia, I ndia, C hina, and S outh Africa). Iran joined BRICS in 2024, and isn’t represented in the acronym. Three of the BRICS nations possess nuclear weapons— Russia, India and China. An economic bloc (BRICS is a soft bloc) that possesses nuclear weapons makes it a geopolitical bloc.

Ritter also identified a complication in the Iranian predicament when he pointed out that Iran’s policy of near-enrichment violated thresholds that the US will not tolerate. However, under existing nuclear agreements, Iran appears to be within its rights to possess the enrichment program that the US is objecting to. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Iranian negotiators had already agreed to the Western level of enrichment, US proxy Israel attacked Iran without warning or provocation.

Ritter’s point is important. But given that Iran is already in compliance under existing agreements, it devolves to might makes right, which is an operational principle, not a legal principle. With Israel’s illegal cache of undeclared nuclear weapons, the US conspicuously couldn’t care less about nuclear proliferation, else its primary target would be Israel. With might-makes-right as its operating principle, the rest of the world can comply with the US or destroy the US. What it cannot do is to negotiate for peace.

In history, the first time that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Iran would have a nuclear weapon ‘within a matter of days’ was thirty years ago. He has been wrong for thirty years. All of the US intelligence services agree that Iran 1) has no nuclear weapon and that 2) Iran has no program to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Netanyahu, like Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, is in power because of his skill at doing the bidding of the US. In the present case, he is simply lying.

Ugly American Lindsey Graham, with 82 of his ugly American brethren and sistren in tow, Senators all, is now demanding the complete destruction of Iran. Why? Iran has no nuclear weapons and it has no nuclear weapons development program. If Mr. Graham truly disagrees, why doesn’t he hash this out with the intelligence agencies? Between them, the bet here is that the intelligence agencies have collected and considered the evidence, whereas Mr. Graham hasn’t.

For those who recall George W. Bush’s ‘Iraq WMD’ fraud, this is well-trodden territory. Mr. Trump’s innovation is to forgo seeking cover from the difficult-to-pin-down ‘international community.’ Implied is that the North – South divide has redefined the relevant boundaries. In attacking Iran, and through it, BRICS, the Western pretense of fealty to ‘the rules-based order’ has given way to the West being the premier rogue international actor.

With the CIA the likely lead in the permanent government’s move to accelerate WWIII in West Asia, Donald Trump seems to have made his peace with the agency. For the American people, this is truly unfortunate. While he revoked security clearances for the rogue elements who directly interfered with his 2020 electoral prospects, he left the operational core unmolested. This is why Genocide Joe is followed by Genocide Don. Carnival barkers for empire, all.

That the tactic of using military drones that had been hidden in anticipation of future use took place mere weeks apart in both Russia and Iran, considered in conjunction with decapitation efforts against both regimes, suggests that a singular geopolitical strategy / actor unites the efforts. That Russia has had an agreement with Iran to build between two and eight nuclear reactors for civilian nuclear purposes complicates the geopolitics.

Debate has raged over whether Trump would honor the commitment. The answer is in. With military equipment being rushed to West Asia, the Zionist genocide remains intact. To be clear, this refers to genocide by Zionists, not genocide against Zionists. Photo source: Middle East Eye.

Donald Trump’s subterfuge by publicly pronouncing ongoing negotiations with Iran as preparations for attacking it were underway will likely turn out to have been too-clever-by-half. The race in future negotiations with the US will be over which party screws the other first. The logical end of this, where communication becomes a matter of competing lie-bots. is particularly unconstructive given the prevalence of nuclear weapons. The limited utility of fake negotiations— they only work once, suggests that maybe real negotiations would have been the better strategy.

That Miriam Adelson paid Donald Trump $100 million to attack Iran, and that Mr. Trump is dutifully doing so, illuminates a brave new way-of-doing-business for the US. Joe Biden performed this same service for only about 4% ($4 million in campaign contributions) of Mr. Trump’s take. Possibly the US wishes to set up a ‘marketplace’ for launching wars for foreign interests. This could be DEI for politicians, bringing equity to the commission of genocide.

As unpleasant as doing so may be under the circumstances, the point must once again be made that Donald Trump’s actions with respect to Israel and Iran date to decisions made by the permanent government of the US in the 1990s – early 2000s. While it would be heartwarming to imagine that Adelson wasted her money on a deal that had already been made, Donald Trump either was never in on the deal, or he lied to his MAGA devotees about wanting peace.

With little ability to affect US foreign policy in the near term, the American people have some decisions to make. Donald Trump and his advisors have been astonishingly reckless with respect to nuclear weapons to date. The Western attack on Russian nuclear assets would have ended humanity were Russia guided by less steady hands. Should Trump use nukes in Iran, no human will get a good night’s sleep for the remainder of human existence.

There is no electoral solution to the problem of Trump, just as there was no electoral solution to the problem of Biden. The permanent government in the US is impervious to electoral outcomes. Donald Trump may have imagined that by firing Federal workers through DOGE, the permanent government would be diminished. But the workers he fired weren’t, with a few exceptions, making policy. The result is that Trump is acting the puppet while believing himself to be the puppeteer.

If they care about living for more than the next few hours, Mr. Trump’s foreign policy handlers should warn him against using nuclear weapons in Iran. While in his lizard brain, Trump may believe that using nuclear weapons will increase the size of his penis (peace through strength) , what doing so would in fact accomplish is to turn it into stardust. Everyone who controls nuclear weapons has the same power that Trump has. Why we need to learn this lesson the hard way is a bit of a mystery.</full_content>

		<full_content>President Donald Trump said France’s Emmanuel Macron was “publicity seeking” for speculating on the purpose of his early departure from the G7 conference in Canada.

Emmanuel Macron was “wrong!” for speculating President Trump excused himself from the G7 meeting in Canada a day early because he was going to deal with Isreal-Iran. Macron had said on Monday: “There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange… U.S. assured they will find a ceasefire and since they can pressure Israel, things may change.”

Firing off a statement on Truth Social while returning to the United States, Trump decried Macron for being “publicity seeking” with his speculation on the President’s agenda. He wrote: “Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!”.

The rebuke may be keenly felt, given President Macron is one of those European leaders who has sought to portray himself as a ‘Trump whisperer’, uniquely well placed to achieve sympathetic outcomes for Europe from America-first. Indeed, in contrast to the first Trump Presidency when Euro leaders defaulted to condescending him, these days it is such a highly valued quality former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was practically offered the NATO Secretary General position for it.</full_content>

		<full_content>With Israel fighting on at least two fronts, the country's finances and economy are strained. The government hopes higher taxes can cover some of the bills while its high-tech industry remains a safe investment.

War is expensive. Besides causing destruction, personal tragedies and deaths, it costs a lot of money to buy and mobilize equipment. It also costs manpower as Israel — and its economy — is finding out on multiple fronts.

Since the militant islamist group Hamas attacked the Jewish state on October 7, 2023, Israel has been engaged in intense fighting in Gaza. After that, Israel launched airstrikes into Lebanon as retaliation for cross-border Hezbollah missile and drone attacks. Last week, Israel struck deep within Iran with the aim of disabling its nuclear capabilities.

Israel has big problems and big budgets

With all this going on, Israel's economy is under significant strain. Many reservists have been called up to fight forcing them to temporarily leave their jobs. Adding to this labor shortage, work permits for many Palestinians have been cancelled and crossing borders has become increasingly difficult for them.

All this makes filling job vacancies difficult. In April, the country reported a 3% unemployment rate, down from 4.8% in 2021.

At the same time, military spending in Israel has surged. In 2024, it grew by 65% to reach $46.5 billion (€40.4 billion), according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published in April. That brings its military spending to 8.8% of GDP — the second highest in the world after Ukraine.

The country's 2025 budget includes spending of 756 billion Israeli shekels ($215 billion; €187 billion) — a 21% rise over the previous year. It is set to be the largest budget in Israeli history and includes $38.6 billion for defense, according to reporting in The Times of Israel.

Israel's economy faces uncertain future

Itai Ater, an economics professor at the Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, says the war is &quot;very expensive&quot; at the moment, and there is &quot;huge uncertainty about the near and long-term future.&quot;

&quot;The military costs on both the offensive and defensive fronts are very high. This will surely impact the budget, the deficit, the GDP and the Israeli debt,&quot; Ater told DW.

The costs are indeed high. In the past 20 months, many Israelis have spent hundreds of days in reserve duty. Others have been evacuated from their homes near border regions leading to big disruptions in their lives. Social services are under strain.

Since last Friday's attacks, many people have not worked, including in manufacturing, trade, tech and the education system, says Ater.

Commercial flights in and out of the country are also currently suspended. Airlines have evacuated their jets and airspace over much of the Middle East is closed.

Israeli government increasing taxes to pay for it all

To compensate for some of this financial strain, the government has increased taxes. The country's value added tax (VAT) for most goods and services went from 17% to 18% at the beginning of this year. The health tax deducted from employee salaries and national insurance contributions went up, too.

The Israeli economy has suffered over the past year and a half but has been &quot;surprisingly resilient,&quot; says Benjamin Bental, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Haifa.

While tourism, manufacturing, construction and farming have suffered, other industries like high-tech, defense and retail food remain resilient. In 2024, the economy brought in over $540 billion, topping both previous years.

Bental points to the continued success of the high-tech sector and the overall labor market that is &quot;as tight as it has ever been.&quot; Warnings that critical energy and internet infrastructure would be targeted by Hezbollah or Iran have, so far, proven unfounded leaving businesses on track.

Israel's high dependence on high-tech

It is no coincidence that Israel is known for its advanced high-tech industry.

The sector employs 12% of the country's workforce and pay around 25% of all income taxes because of their high salaries, according to US investment bank Jefferies . High-tech services and products make up 64% of the country's exports and around 20% of total GDP.

But the number of high-tech employees in Israel has stagnated since 2022, according to a report released in April by the Israel Innovation Authority.

In 2024, the number of local high-tech employees decreased for the first time in a decade. At the same time the number of employees leaving the country for long-term relocation increased, the report found.

Today, these companies still have around 390,000 employees in Israel and a further 440,000 outside the country. Some fear higher taxes could push more mobile companies or workers to leave.

Investors and long-term risks

The biggest unknown now is the general uncertainty of the situation in and around Israel. This impacts workers, employers and investors.

&quot;Nevertheless, if you look at the stock market and the foreign exchange rate, it seems that investors are optimistic, likely anticipating that the war would end soon, that Iran's nuclear threat would be eliminated and that the economy would recover and get better,&quot; said Ater.

For investors, the short-term risks have increased, but the real impact depends on how long the military conflicts last and how they end.

&quot;An alternative scenario, in which we enter a long attrition war with Iran, is also likely,&quot; said Ater. &quot;In that case, the economy is unlikely to flourish.&quot;

Looking ahead, Ater sees the security situation in general, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular, as one of the country's long-term economic challenges. Besides these tensions he says it will be important to also keep an eye on the country's internal social divide and the judicial overhaul and its implications on democratic institutions.

		<full_content>With Israel fighting on at least two fronts, the country's finances and economy are strained. The government hopes higher taxes can cover some of the bills while its high-tech industry remains a safe investment.

War is expensive. Besides causing destruction, personal tragedies and deaths, it costs a lot of money to buy and mobilize equipment. It also costs manpower as Israel — and its economy — is finding out on multiple fronts.

Since the militant islamist group Hamas attacked the Jewish state on October 7, 2023, Israel has been engaged in intense fighting in Gaza. After that, Israel launched airstrikes into Lebanon as retaliation for cross-border Hezbollah missile and drone attacks. Last week, Israel struck deep within Iran with the aim of disabling its nuclear capabilities.

Israel has big problems and big budgets

With all this going on, Israel's economy is under significant strain. Many reservists have been called up to fight forcing them to temporarily leave their jobs. Adding to this labor shortage, work permits for many Palestinians have been cancelled and crossing borders has become increasingly difficult for them.

All this makes filling job vacancies difficult. In April, the country reported a 3% unemployment rate, down from 4.8% in 2021.

At the same time, military spending in Israel has surged. In 2024, it grew by 65% to reach $46.5 billion (€40.4 billion), according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published in April. That brings its military spending to 8.8% of GDP — the second highest in the world after Ukraine.

The country's 2025 budget includes spending of 756 billion Israeli shekels ($215 billion; €187 billion) — a 21% rise over the previous year. It is set to be the largest budget in Israeli history and includes $38.6 billion for defense, according to reporting in The Times of Israel.

Israel's economy faces uncertain future

Itai Ater, an economics professor at the Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, says the war is &quot;very expensive&quot; at the moment, and there is &quot;huge uncertainty about the near and long-term future.&quot;

&quot;The military costs on both the offensive and defensive fronts are very high. This will surely impact the budget, the deficit, the GDP and the Israeli debt,&quot; Ater told DW.

The costs are indeed high. In the past 20 months, many Israelis have spent hundreds of days in reserve duty. Others have been evacuated from their homes near border regions leading to big disruptions in their lives. Social services are under strain.

Since last Friday's attacks, many people have not worked, including in manufacturing, trade, tech and the education system, says Ater.

Commercial flights in and out of the country are also currently suspended. Airlines have evacuated their jets and airspace over much of the Middle East is closed.

Israeli government increasing taxes to pay for it all

To compensate for some of this financial strain, the government has increased taxes. The country's value added tax (VAT) for most goods and services went from 17% to 18% at the beginning of this year. The health tax deducted from employee salaries and national insurance contributions went up, too.

The Israeli economy has suffered over the past year and a half but has been &quot;surprisingly resilient,&quot; says Benjamin Bental, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Haifa.

While tourism, manufacturing, construction and farming have suffered, other industries like high-tech, defense and retail food remain resilient. In 2024, the economy brought in over $540 billion, topping both previous years.

Bental points to the continued success of the high-tech sector and the overall labor market that is &quot;as tight as it has ever been.&quot; Warnings that critical energy and internet infrastructure would be targeted by Hezbollah or Iran have, so far, proven unfounded leaving businesses on track.

Israel's high dependence on high-tech

It is no coincidence that Israel is known for its advanced high-tech industry.

The sector employs 12% of the country's workforce and pay around 25% of all income taxes because of their high salaries, according to US investment bank Jefferies . High-tech services and products make up 64% of the country's exports and around 20% of total GDP.

But the number of high-tech employees in Israel has stagnated since 2022, according to a report released in April by the Israel Innovation Authority.

In 2024, the number of local high-tech employees decreased for the first time in a decade. At the same time the number of employees leaving the country for long-term relocation increased, the report found.

Today, these companies still have around 390,000 employees in Israel and a further 440,000 outside the country. Some fear higher taxes could push more mobile companies or workers to leave.

Investors and long-term risks

The biggest unknown now is the general uncertainty of the situation in and around Israel. This impacts workers, employers and investors.

&quot;Nevertheless, if you look at the stock market and the foreign exchange rate, it seems that investors are optimistic, likely anticipating that the war would end soon, that Iran's nuclear threat would be eliminated and that the economy would recover and get better,&quot; said Ater.

For investors, the short-term risks have increased, but the real impact depends on how long the military conflicts last and how they end.

&quot;An alternative scenario, in which we enter a long attrition war with Iran, is also likely,&quot; said Ater. &quot;In that case, the economy is unlikely to flourish.&quot;

Looking ahead, Ater sees the security situation in general, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular, as one of the country's long-term economic challenges. Besides these tensions he says it will be important to also keep an eye on the country's internal social divide and the judicial overhaul and its implications on democratic institutions.

		<full_content>AYIA NAPA, Cyprus — Israel has wiped out a third of Iran’s total ballistic missile launchers since Thursday, drastically reducing the risk Iran poses not just to the Jewish state but the world, Israel Defense Forces officials told The Post.

Israel has eliminated 120 Iranian missile launchers since Israel’s Operation Rising Lion began, leaving the Iranian regime with less and less leverage over Israel and its partners as it clings to roughly 66% of the arsenal it had just four days ago, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Monday.

The accomplishment has already had an effect on Tehran’s fight, as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched fewer than 50 missiles at Israel last night — roughly half as many the Iranian regime’s prior barrages, a separate IDF official said.

“The Israeli Air Force struck over 100 military targets in Iran overnight,” the person said. “The strikes focused on central Iran — the main area where missile launchers and ballistic missiles remain.”

Among those targets were more than 20 missiles being prepared for imminent launches at Israel.

“Based on precise intelligence, launch teams that were either operating from command centers or en route to carry out launches against Israel were eliminated during the strikes,” the official said.

The operation’s success was made possible because Israel secured “full operational control over Tehran” in just three days, according to the official — something Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to do over Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, in more than 3.5 years of war.

“Some of (the eliminated 20 missiles) were identified by IAF aircraft just minutes before their planned launch, covered on in plastic,” the official said.

That air superiority is also enabling Israel to continue “targeting Iranian cells in real time as they launch missiles toward the state of Israel and our aircraft,” Defrin said.

“The aerial capabilities we previously saw in Gaza, Lebanon and Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank) are now operational in Iran,” he said.

Israel continued targeting Iranian missiles and missile launchers throughout Monday, with the Israeli Air Force identifying “several trucks containing weapons, including trucks transporting surface-to-air missile launchers, advancing from western Iran toward Tehran, while attempting to escape IDF strikes,” a Israeli military official said.

“The IAF struck the trucks, neutralizing the weapons and launchers,” the person said.

In addition to the Israeli-destroyed Iranian missiles, officials estimate Iran has launched roughly 370 ballistic missiles at Israel in the past days — meaning Tehran could be down to just half to one-third of its total missiles it had before the conflict began

Additionally, Israel targeted more than 20 Iranian military and Quds Force command centers, killing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s head of intelligence, his deputy and the deputy head of the Quds Force’s intelligence organization.

“The Quds Force has been the main conduit for many of the terrorist attacks and assaults against Israel in recent decades,” Defrin said. “Now, the command centers where these attacks were planned have been completely destroyed.”

“The Quds Force is the central terror arm of the Iranian regime. It is responsible for operating Iran’s proxies around Israel’s borders and for distributing weapons and missiles intended for attack the state of Israel,” he added.

However, Iran still managed to strike four different areas in northern and central Israel Sunday night, killing eight civilians and injuring dozens more, Defrin said.

“This is the face of the Iranian terror regime: While we target military and nuclear capabilities intended to destroy the state of Israel, they fire at population centers with the aim of harming civilians,” he said.

“This is precisely why we launched the operation: to eliminate the existential threat posed to the state of Israel: the nuclear and missile threats.”</full_content>

In a surprise attack in the dead of night, Israel took out several members of Iran’s top military chain of command. Explosions rang out in half a dozen Iranian cities, pulverizing apartment blocks and disabling some of the country’s missile batteries, as well as the aboveground portions of Iran’s main enrichment plant at Natanz. Iran reported that 78 people were killed and more than 320 were wounded, the majority of the victims being civilians.

Few people can explain, in plain terms, just how the attack played out on the ground, and what ordinary Iranians make of a night that leveled homes while killing the commanders who ordered crackdowns on protestors within the country just a few years ago. Reza Talebi is a journalist who has lived on every side of this drama. Talebi served as a captain in Iran’s air force, trained as an air traffic controller, and once monitored the very radar screens Israel reportedly attacked. The regime later jailed him for three years, after which he fled to Turkey, earned a Ph.D. in international law, and today reports for BBC International from Leipzig, Germany, where he writes in four languages. Crucially, Talebi still trades messages with friends inside Iran’s air defense network, three of whom died in Friday’s strike on the Tabriz radar station. Talebi walked me through how the events unfolded in a candid phone call. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: By now, everyone has seen the news that Israel pounded Iran with a series of strikes. Could you tell me how exactly it unfolded from your perspective?

Reza Talebi: Around half-past 3 a.m., Israeli aircraft attacked from inside Iranian airspace. You may already know this, but Iran does not have a comprehensive system against missiles and airstrikes. Half their air defenses are from the ’70s, ’60s and older, with radar dating back to the Iran–Iraq war. Iran tried to modernize it, but they couldn’t because of internal conflicts between the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] and the Iranian army.

I know people who were working the Tabriz radars that night. They described to me how it began with Israel jamming the radar systems, first hacking them and then striking them with missiles, making Iran blind in the northwest. Israel then entered Iranian airspace and struck more than 100 targets, like the aboveground nuclear base in Natanz, near Isfahan. Soon after, they received alerts from city centers, including Tehran. What was more shocking was to learn that Israeli Mossad was able to conduct a strike that involved setting up a UAV base from within Tehran to attack the offices and homes of IRGC commanders. They killed nearly 20 people, including scientists. This is a major humiliation for the Iranian government, that Israel proved it can strike from within Iran, including at the center of Iran.

Israel has been talking about bombing Iran for decades now. Why do you think they decided to strike now?

This all came just after Trump gave Iran an ultimatum to concede on their negotiations. This is also the perfect time for Israel when they have the advantage. Israel has already severely weakened proxy groups, like Hezbollah and the Houthis, and now they must believe they can withstand a war on all of those fronts. At the same time, there are whispers about Israeli efforts to support guerrilla rebels within Iran and sow internal conflict.

Iran has already retaliated by launching from its arsenal of 150,000 ballistic missiles, like they had last year, but they are not very accurate because they do not have updated GPS technology. But I think Iran would be better off not continuing to retaliate, given that the international community has already shown that it is willing to tolerate Israel killing 60,000 people in Gaza and starving the survivors, so the international community will not hesitate if Israel and the United States destroys the country. [Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei understands that Iran cannot fight Israel and the United States. But now, they are in a position where they need to apply some pressure back on Israel. Khamenei’s statement shows that he understands this, because it is in my opinion very tempered. But it continues to be a tricky situation for the Iranian government. It’s possible they have nuclear bombs; after all, the Washington Post reported last year that Iran has acquired enough enriched uranium to produce nuclear bombs. And if that is the case, and Iran deploys a nuclear ballistic missile against Israel, after this, Iran will also face global isolation, leading to social and economic collapse. So it’s better in every way for Iran to not retaliate strongly against Israel. Now, they must try and save their people, because the alternative is being destroyed by the United States and Israel.

What are you hearing from people in Iran right now?

We have a broad diversity of people in Iran. Some are praying to God for the downfall of the mullah regime, and though they doubt Israel will help them, at least they could kill him. There are many Iranians who are tired of the government but believe there is no better alternative. There is also the existence of Islamist groups that emerged after Saddam’s war against Iran. There are also many Turks, Kurds, and others, who all have their dense, small communities, who each have their own ideas for how Iran should be led, and feel like the Iranian regime is occupying them and does not invest enough in their communities.

On top of this, there is also a generational gap. There are people my mother’s age who went out for a picnic, believing they’d rather be killed by an Israeli airstrike than live their lives afraid of them. There are also very young Iranians born post–Islamic Revolution who think of this as a golden opportunity for an uprising. But 90 percent of the people I’ve spoken to are afraid of the war because there are so many wars in the Middle East, like in Syria, Afghanistan, and Palestine, and they are afraid their people will also begin to experience the same pain and loss in their country.

Have you heard from anyone who was in close proximity to any of the Israeli airstrikes?

I have a close friend, a lieutenant in the air force, who was on duty in one of the radar stations struck by Israel. He said in a split second, after spotting the Israeli missile, he reacted and somehow survived. I had many friends at that station. Three of them died in that strike.

I also spoke to someone in Tehran who lived in one of the areas struck by Israel. He said he doesn’t believe the official government death toll. He claims that what he saw in Tehran with his own eyes indicates that closer to 150 people died in Tehran alone. He was in shock. He was in Tehran and survived an Iraqi bombardment of the city, and now he says he is seeing the same thing in Tehran. I heard a similar story from a grandma in Tehran. Another friend, a painter, spoke to me for about an hour. For 10 minutes straight, she only cried. She told me she saw situations like this only in the movies.

What do you think is going to be the biggest indication of where things are headed?

Honestly, just like any other person, I want the best for my country. But I’m a pessimist. Our government is not tied to Islamic revelation. It’s a Frankenstein system, and I can’t recognize or understand it anymore. We need to destroy this system. But it needs to be us. Not foreigners. Not colonist countries. It’s difficult to destroy, but it’s our job.

What’s next? I expect Iran to negotiate directly with the United States to resolve this conflict. We just don’t have means to retaliate against Israel, and Israel isn’t interested in diplomatic resolutions. But though Iran is weak, run by a dictator, I don’t believe they want to risk destroying the whole country. Every Iranian wants to protect Iran. We put pressure on our leaders as intellectuals and journalists, men and women, to make good decisions to save our country. But all of us know that if Iran continues to retaliate, Israel will destroy us. Iranians must reform the system from within. That is the only way to create a future for our children.

I think now the Iranian government understands they are under pressure. If they cannot change, the United States will change them, through the hand of Netanyahu. The government understands this is possible. Iran’s best hope is to stop its retaliation and find a diplomatic solution. That is our only chance for peace.</full_content>

Russia Responds to Israel's Strikes on Iran: 'Full-Scale War' Possible

Newsweek ^ | 6/13/2025 | Barney Henderson

Posted on by marcusmaximus

An ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that &quot;a full-scale war&quot; in the Middle East is possible following Israel's airstrikes on Iran.

-snip-

Konstantin Kosachev, vice-speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, made clear that Russia would stand by its ally, Iran.

&quot;Israel's actions cannot be justified from a legal, political, military or moral point of view. The only hope, albeit illusory, of avoiding a full-scale war is a consolidated condemnation of this operation by the international community,&quot; he said, according to Russia's official TASS news agency.

&quot;We can and must hope for another demonstration of restraint from Iran. One must always hope for the best, but naturally there are limits to [Iran's] patience.&quot;

This is a ridiculous article. Israel and Iran have been at war since October 7. The Iranians ordered the Hamas October 7 attacks to derail the Middle East Abraham Accords and instigate a major regional war against Israel by a coalition of Arab states. Iran and it's entire terrorist proxy army network in Gaza, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen (to name a few) has been throwing everything they have at Israel and the US in the region for going on two years. They have lost their war to destroy Israel. If they had any more resources to throw into the fight they would have already done so. If Iran or their proxies execute terrorist attacks on the US they need to be dealt with with overwhelming and disproportionate force. Iran simply cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons and more capable missiles Putin is no doubt unhappy with the recent turn of events as he has been trying to force the US to divert weapons that could be used in the Ukraine into the Middle East and pin the US down in the region but this has backfired and Russia has essentially been kicked out of the Middle East and Israel is dismantling the Iranian military industrial complex that is supporting Russia in Ukraine.

Sabre rattling from a country that doesn’t have much of a military left, after what was supposed to be a 2 week event to take over Ukraine. They were buying Iranian drones and that’s why they are pissed. No more Iranian drones after the Israelis are finished. I have no doubt that Israel could take out Russia if it wanted to. The intelligence the Mossad have is incredible. They got the top Iranian air force commanders in one strike, and when they are done Iran will be an impotent wasteland.

Yes, we’ve been inundated with trolls and antisemites, some with long standing registrations and sporadic posting history, with multi year gaps. Reeks of paid plants. The hardcore antisemites post on Saturday when they know Jewish freepers (who are generally religious) won’t respond.

A message to the Iranians: don't count on any Russian military support. How dare you malign Putin's valiant North Korean troops! Putin is probably already preparing to announce another &quot;Special Military Operation.&quot; After all, he still has two-thirds of his long-range cruise missile-capable bombers! And it's not like the Israelis already had any experience in covertly establishing drone-launch sites in enemy territory, is it? Putin would be wise to redeploy all of his aircraft to somewhere where they would be safe from drone-attacks - maybe the Kamchatka Peninsula? Of course, Putin has lost his sole Mediterranean naval base, in Tartus (Syria). But he still commands a significant naval fighting force in the Mediterranean - one which almost rivals its proud Black Sea fleet! Regards,

To: spincaster

They won’t attack Israel. At this point, they are no match for Israel and they know it. The Russian military has been reduced to bare bones with their war on Ukraine. They were buying drones from Iran. Mossad’s spies are probably already inside Russia’s military.



To: marcusmaximus

&quot;Israel's actions cannot be justified from a legal, political, military or moral point of view. But invading Ukraine in order to conquer it, under the premise that NATO is a needless deterrent, is.

		<full_content>Smoke billows in the distance from an oil refinery following an Israeli strike on the Iranian capital Tehran on June 17, 2025.

Analysts are struggling to predict the extent to which Israel and Iran's escalating conflict could influence oil prices.

Israel's surprise attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure on Friday has been followed by five days of spiraling warfare between the regional foes.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for an &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; from Tehran, warning Washington's patience was wearing thin. In response, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened the U.S. with &quot;irreparable damage&quot; in the event of a military intervention, according to NBC News reporting.

Energy markets are weighing the likelihood of direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, as well as the potential for major supply disruptions — particularly worst-case scenarios, such as Iran blocking the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz that links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman.

John Evans, an analyst at oil broker PVM, said Wednesday that a &quot;blanket of unease&quot; had descended upon oil markets in recent days.

&quot;Our market is settling into a world where missile exchanges are commonplace but the cynicism of it being normal has yet to set in because of how easily the situation could escalate,&quot; Evans said in a research note.</full_content>

‘Axis of sitting ducks’: Why Hezbollah cannot afford to defend Iran from Israel’s attacks

The National ^ | June 13, 2025 | Nada Homsi Nada Maucourant Atallah Jamie Prentis

Posted on by sopo

Lebanese Hezbollah’s military defeat after 14 months of conflict with Israel has left it politically and militarily constrained and in no position to support its ally Iran in any future confrontation with Israel, analysts, military experts, and western diplomats told The National.

Israel’s deadly overnight strike on Iran decapitated much of Tehran’s military and nuclear leadership. And a broader regional offensive by Israel over the past two years has severely weakened Iranian proxies across the region, leaving Hezbollah unable to come to its sponsor’s aid.

Under normal circumstances “Hezbollah would definitely respond to the Iranian attack right away,” according to Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut and an expert on Iran’s proxies. “But now I think we are in a different phase and it's a very defeated organisation struggling to rebuild after the hits it has taken.

US nuclear talks 'unjustifiable' after Israeli attack, says Iran's Araghchi LatestUS nuclear talks 'unjustifiable' after Israeli attack, says Iran's Araghchi Read More “Hezbollah is in a difficult position. Iran is in need of support from its closest ally and they are incapable of delivering,” he added.

With Iranian backing, Hezbollah had steadily bolstered its strength over four decades, evolving from a guerrilla movement into a powerful paramilitary force that posed a significant threat to Israel from the southern Lebanese border.

Until recently, the Lebanese group was the most powerful of Iran’s network of regional militias, serving as Tehran’s first line of defence against Israeli threats. Israel has worked to dismantle Iran’s regional proxies – known as the ‘Axis of Resistance’ – “piece by piece”, according to Mr Hage Ali. “The Lebanon part [of the axis] has been diminished significantly,” with Hezbollah suffering a “humiliating defeat”

Israel’s offensive on Hezbollah, which escalated in September 2024, took out the vast majority of the group’s top leadership and destroyed most of its arsenal.

And the group’s ouster from the southernmost part of Lebanon – south of the Litani river – means Hezbollah “no longer has military capabilities along Israel’s borders,” according to military analyst Riad Kahwaji, who is head of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis.

By Israeli and US intelligence estimates, around 70 per cent of Hezbollah’s military capabilities have been destroyed.

Even if Hezbollah were in a position to attack, its main supply route by land through Syria was cut when its ally in neighbouring Syria, Bashar Al Assad, was deposed last December by rebels who Hezbollah themselves had spent years fighting- meaning it would have difficulties replenishing for even the limited stores it has left.

“We’ve reached a place where it’s really inconceivable that we see the organisation respond with force to [the attack on Iran] by the Israelis,” Mr Hage Ali said.

“I’m pretty sure Hezbollah will do nothing in this situation,” said Gen Mounir Shehadeh, who until recently was the Lebanese government's co-ordinator with the UN peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon (Unifil).

Even Hezbollah’s statement condemning the Israeli attacks - which it described as having ”no justification” - lacked its typical vitriolic and violent undertones, warning the Israel’s actions would not go unpunished but little else in terms of threats.

Despite Hezbollah not being in a position to retaliate, a potential intervention which could drag Lebanon into yet another deadly conflict had nonetheless worried western diplomats.

“Hezbollah’s intervention was the question mark that has worried Lebanese in recent days, the concern that a resumption of war could come in connection with what’s happening in Iran. So that’s where our main concern lies,” a western diplomatic source said.

Schools across the south and in the southern suburbs have closed their doors and instructed their students to stay home as a precaution amid fears of escalation.

Lebanese leaders and western diplomats are aware that Lebanon’s relative stability is hanging in the balance. The US and France scrambled to reach a shaky, if uneven, ceasefire in Lebanon. But the ceasefire, and Hezbollah’s defeat, has led to a de facto political reality: Israel can strike at will in Lebanon, but Hezbollah – and Lebanon – would be severely punished for attacking or retaliating.

“The important thing for us is to preserve Lebanon and to ensure that there are no misguided ideas of supporting the war from Lebanon, or any kind of intervention whether it be by Hezbollah or any other groups,” the western diplomat said.

Diplomatic sources previously told The National: “Hezbollah thought it would be like 2006, and that the vague terms of the ceasefire would work in their favour,” the source said, referring to the agreement that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, and which forms the basis of the current truce. “But this is not 2006.”

Lebanon has effectively developed into a new status quo in the days following its November 2024 ceasefire with Israel: Israel continues to occupy five points of Lebanese territory as it bombs parts of Lebanon on a near-daily basis. Hezbollah, militarily depleted and wary of inflicting further war on its population, has largely remained unresponsive.

According to Mr Hage Ali, “Hezbollah can launch an attack for sure, and kill Israelis. But the question is what will happen next for them. They can’t ensure there won’t be any follow up attack [by Isreal]. It’s not an easy one for them.”

Meanwhile, Iran – isolated, bereft of its once ample proxy forces, and scrambling to restructure its command structure after the Israeli attack – has been left to fend for itself against Israel.

“Iran has joined the axis of sitting ducks,” said Mr Hage Ali.

There are procedures and mechanisms in place for Israel to take care of any significant Hezbollah activity in Lebanon. When something happens, or is detected, the official Lebanese government attempts to address it. If they cannot resolve the situation, they notify Israel, and Israel takes care of it.

I can sum up the article in three sentences. 1. Hezbollah went to war with Israel.

2. Hezbollah lost their asses in the war, actually literally as their cell phones exploded in a most amusing display and at the same time were decimated militarily.

3. Those not dead do not want to die.

Proxies in the Great Game often only remain your proxies as long as you can supply continuous support. They tend to take a “what have you done for us lately” approach when you can’t give them anything concrete immediately... and Iran can’t deliver anything.

Neutralizing them seems critical to being able to keep it a more-or-less regional war, hoping for the best.

Pretty sure just about everyone in the area is actually tired of the Houthis and Iran at this point. You’ll notice that there’s been no cries of solidarity with Iran from the usual suspects?

Time for Lebanese to take up revolution and get rid of the radicals. Beirut was once beautiful. For that matter so was Damascus and Tehran.

Hezbollah barely exists any more. They were crushed by Israel, their remnants run out of Syria by the new regime, and have been neutered in their last refuge and “home” in Lebanon. The past 2 years have been a disaster for Hezbollah.

Neocons Dragging Trump into WWIII – Martin Armstrong

USA Watchdog ^ | 18 June 25 | Greg Hunter

Posted on by delta7

Two weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong was signaling a big turn toward war. We all know Ukraine is out of control with no peace deal in sight, and now the Middle East is blowing up too. Armstrong says, “I think Trump has been kind of snookered into this . . . Netanyahu knew he could not get the nuclear. Now, he says we are losing because they have not been able to achieve that. So, Netanyahu says President Trump, please go in and attack Iran and eliminate that, which is World War III. . .. Iran is not by itself. We have to consider what is going to take place here. . .. I am concerned this drags in Russia and also China. . .. You have Zelensky over there conspiring with Britain to use an old Soviet torpedo to sink an American ship so they can blame that on Russia. You have the same nonsense in the Middle East so they can create a false flag there to say Iran attacked American forces. They are trying to drag Trump into World War III. These neocons are horrible people. They have no humanity, and they do not care about how many people die.”

For anyone hoping this would blow over or not be too severe, forget that. Socrates, Armstrong’s computer program that is extremely accurate, says this is going to be a long and very bad dream. Armstrong says, “Socrates is not showing this is going to be over swiftly and ending. It is warning that this is going to be more protracted. On top of that, Iran has supersonic missiles. They had them before we did. They claim they domestically developed them, but it’s widely believed Russia helped them. In addition to that, about 80% of the oil from Iran goes to China. This, to me, is a classic neocon blunder.”

Things are going to be bad in the US but much worse in Europe. Armstrong says, “If they turn this into a Jihad or holy war, it will go absolutely crazy. You are going to be looking at civil war in virtually every city. This is not good. If you are looking at war that is a dispute over a border or economics, you can come to some sort of negotiation. You cannot do that when you are talking about a religious war. . .. If you take out the Supreme Leader, you are going to turn this into a religious war. You are looking at Muslims reacting in Europe and even the United States. This is s different type of war, and we better damn well respect that.”

Armstrong thinks gold will hit some resistance at around $4,000 per ounce and then go up to $5,000 per ounce. When that happens, Armstrong says silver will easily hit $50 per ounce and beyond. Armstrong says oil could hit $115 a barrel sometime in July, and it could go higher from there.

In closing, I asked Armstrong what he would tell President Trump right now. Armstrong says, “We are in a war cycle, and it is a contagion. . .. Get the hell out of Ukraine, and get the hell out of the Middle East.”….

There is much more in the 63-minute interview.

They may be trying, but they are not being successful, because Trump will only do it because he sees a positive for the world, which I am not convinced, even a little bit, that he does see that, unless the regime change comes from the Iranian people themselves, but he is certainly willing to give them a hand up if that is their desire.

The talk of this turning into a Jihad relies on a couple of things: Jihadis and money. There will never be a shortage of jihadis. That is the nature of the beast. We will never be free of that. The second is a bit easier. Iran was funding most of the terrorist activities in the past forty years. Without them on the field, the funding dries up. Prior to the that, the Soviets were funding the PLO. They have been neutered as well. We can tell Russia to keep their nose out of this business and we will come to a solution in Ukraine that works for them. China just wants cheap Iranian oil. That is easily addressed as well. So, if you give this any real strategic thought, having a peaceful Middle East is in everyone’s best interest.

President Trump’s not going to war and I trust his judgement on this. Armstrong is often wrong and is just pleading the worst possible case. We’re not going to war. Fire off a few bunker busters maybe, but that’s hardly a going to war. We don’t even need an air campaign because Israel already took care of that. We certainly don’t need boots on the ground. President Trump knows this instinctively. Most of the Middle East Muslims (Sunnis) hate the Iranians (Shi’ites) and have been signaling they wouldn’t mind us piling on. They’re not even condemning Israel too much. Any further damage to Iran wouldn’t bat a blink from them, let alone WWIII!!! I think Armstrong isn’t stupid, but in this case, who knows? He certainly is delivering a message, but whose?

The software that lost over $700,000,000 of his clients’ funds in a failed ponzi scheme that netted Armstrong eleven years in jail.

Martin Armstrong matches Scott Ritter in inaccurate predictions (still waiting on the Russians defeating the Ukrainians in three weeks). He is the Al Gore of the alt-right, always predicting doom.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Iranian state television says the head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is feared dead after an Israeli attack.

The report offered few other details about what happened to Gen. Hossein Salami of the Guard.

The report on air added that one other top Guard officials, as well as two nuclear scientists were also feared dead.

State television also reported the attack set the headquarters of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard ablaze.

On Friday, the 13th of June, Israel launched a surprise attack on multiple targets across Iran. Israel strikes hit missile sites and nuclear facilities, and more recently also targeted Iranian state tv.





The two nations have subsequently traded missile attacks over the following days, an escalation to the conflict, which is now the biggest between these two longstanding adversaries.





New Statesman editor Tom McTague meets Lawrence Freedman, Professor Emeritus of War Studies at King's College London, to discuss the conflict between Israel and Iran.

Neocons Dragging Trump into WWIII – Martin Armstrong

USA Watchdog ^ | 18 June 25 | Greg Hunter

Posted on by delta7

Two weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong was signaling a big turn toward war. We all know Ukraine is out of control with no peace deal in sight, and now the Middle East is blowing up too. Armstrong says, “I think Trump has been kind of snookered into this . . . Netanyahu knew he could not get the nuclear. Now, he says we are losing because they have not been able to achieve that. So, Netanyahu says President Trump, please go in and attack Iran and eliminate that, which is World War III. . .. Iran is not by itself. We have to consider what is going to take place here. . .. I am concerned this drags in Russia and also China. . .. You have Zelensky over there conspiring with Britain to use an old Soviet torpedo to sink an American ship so they can blame that on Russia. You have the same nonsense in the Middle East so they can create a false flag there to say Iran attacked American forces. They are trying to drag Trump into World War III. These neocons are horrible people. They have no humanity, and they do not care about how many people die.”

For anyone hoping this would blow over or not be too severe, forget that. Socrates, Armstrong’s computer program that is extremely accurate, says this is going to be a long and very bad dream. Armstrong says, “Socrates is not showing this is going to be over swiftly and ending. It is warning that this is going to be more protracted. On top of that, Iran has supersonic missiles. They had them before we did. They claim they domestically developed them, but it’s widely believed Russia helped them. In addition to that, about 80% of the oil from Iran goes to China. This, to me, is a classic neocon blunder.”

Things are going to be bad in the US but much worse in Europe. Armstrong says, “If they turn this into a Jihad or holy war, it will go absolutely crazy. You are going to be looking at civil war in virtually every city. This is not good. If you are looking at war that is a dispute over a border or economics, you can come to some sort of negotiation. You cannot do that when you are talking about a religious war. . .. If you take out the Supreme Leader, you are going to turn this into a religious war. You are looking at Muslims reacting in Europe and even the United States. This is s different type of war, and we better damn well respect that.”

Armstrong thinks gold will hit some resistance at around $4,000 per ounce and then go up to $5,000 per ounce. When that happens, Armstrong says silver will easily hit $50 per ounce and beyond. Armstrong says oil could hit $115 a barrel sometime in July, and it could go higher from there.

In closing, I asked Armstrong what he would tell President Trump right now. Armstrong says, “We are in a war cycle, and it is a contagion. . .. Get the hell out of Ukraine, and get the hell out of the Middle East.”….

There is much more in the 63-minute interview.

They may be trying, but they are not being successful, because Trump will only do it because he sees a positive for the world, which I am not convinced, even a little bit, that he does see that, unless the regime change comes from the Iranian people themselves, but he is certainly willing to give them a hand up if that is their desire.

The talk of this turning into a Jihad relies on a couple of things: Jihadis and money. There will never be a shortage of jihadis. That is the nature of the beast. We will never be free of that. The second is a bit easier. Iran was funding most of the terrorist activities in the past forty years. Without them on the field, the funding dries up. Prior to the that, the Soviets were funding the PLO. They have been neutered as well. We can tell Russia to keep their nose out of this business and we will come to a solution in Ukraine that works for them. China just wants cheap Iranian oil. That is easily addressed as well. So, if you give this any real strategic thought, having a peaceful Middle East is in everyone’s best interest.

From what I read, the people of Iran are fed up with the mullahs and want them gone. Sure, there are fanatics among them, but perhaps the patriots outnumber them and will fight to restore their country.

“Two weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong was signaling a big turn toward war.” He failed to predict his three bankrupsies. He failed to predict his losing $700 million of his clients’funds. He failed to predict he would spend eleven years in the federal pen. In 2014 he predicted gold would soar to $5,000 in 2015. In 2014 he predicted that there would be a world financial collapse would occur in 2015. July 2024 he predicted US cIvil unrest/WAR to happen just before the 2024 elections. November 2024 he predicted a US civil war would happen the week of Trump’s inauguration with the US breaking up into four new countries in 2026. December 2024 he said via Socrates that the 2024 elections would be the last in the US. January 2025 he predicted US civil unrest on May 7.

President Trump’s not going to war and I trust his judgement on this. Armstrong is often wrong and is just pleading the worst possible case. We’re not going to war. Fire off a few bunker busters maybe, but that’s hardly a going to war. We don’t even need an air campaign because Israel already took care of that. We certainly don’t need boots on the ground. President Trump knows this instinctively. Most of the Middle East Muslims (Sunnis) hate the Iranians (Shi’ites) and have been signaling they wouldn’t mind us piling on. They’re not even condemning Israel too much. Any further damage to Iran wouldn’t bat a blink from them, let alone WWIII!!! I think Armstrong isn’t stupid, but in this case, who knows? He certainly is delivering a message, but whose?

“Armstrong thinks gold will hit some resistance at around $4,000 per ounce and then go up to $5,000 per ounce. “ In 2014 Armstrong said gold would hit $5,000 in 2015. We are only half way their now in today’s dollars! And you can have access to this and more by subscribing ($150/month) to his legendary Socrates. The software that lost over $700,000,000 of his clients’ funds in a failed ponzi scheme that netted Armstrong eleven years in jail.



To: Alas Babylon!

“I think Armstrong isn’t stupid, but in this case, who knows? He certainly is delivering a message, but whose?” Stupid is as stupid does. Three bankruptcies. Eleven years in jail. Now trolling for suckers willing to subscribe to his fake forecasts.



To: TexasGator

Martin Armstrong matches Scott Ritter in inaccurate predictions (still waiting on the Russians defeating the Ukrainians in three weeks). He is the Al Gore of the alt-right, always predicting doom.

		<full_content>Kenmare Resources has walked away from takeover talks with its former managing director Michael Carvill and an Abu Dhabi private equity firm after the consortium made it clear it would only be willing to proceed with a bid that was below its initial £473 million (€553 million) proposal.

Shares in the titanium minerals miner plunged as much as 23.3 per cent in Dublin to levels near where the stock was trading in early March, before it emerged that it had received a bid approach.

Kenmare said in a statement on Thursday that its board unanimously rejected the revised pricing “on the basis that it significantly undervalued Kenmare’s business and its prospects”.

Kenmare, which operates the Moma mine in Mozambique, confirmed on March 6th that it had received an approach from Mr Carvill, who founded Kenmare in 1986 and led it until his exit last August, and Oryx Global Partners Limited on foot of an Irish Times article that the former MD was circling the business.

It said at the time that it had rejected the original proposal, pitched at £5.30 per share, as undervaluing the company. However, it offered the consortium access to its books to carry out due diligence, with a view to improving the offer.

Mr Carvill told The Irish Times the lower proposal was partly down to concerns about titanium minerals prices as the global economic outlook has deteriorated since the initial bid approach, amid concerns about the Trump administration’s trade policies and escalating conflict in the Middle East. It also reflected how the Mozambique government is seeking higher mineral processing and exporting royalties from Kenmare, he said in response to questions.

“Kenmare supported the consortium in its due diligence process and gave the possible offer extensive consideration, despite its early stage and unsolicited nature,” chairman Andrew Webb said. “The board will continue to review all opportunities to create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders”

Mr Webb said Kenmare was “highly confident” in its prospects as an independent company and its ability to deliver on its strategic and operational objectives.

“Moma is one of the world’s largest titanium minerals deposits, with a multi-decade mine life, a consistent low-cost profile, and substantial inherent value. Kenmare remains on track to achieve its 2025 production guidance and has a strong order book for the second half of 2025,” he added.

The announcement of the breakdown in talks comes a day before a so-called put-up-or-shut-up bid deadline was due to run out. The Irish Takeover Panel had originally given the consortium until mid-April to make a revised offer, but subsequently extended it twice as talks continued.

A key issue in the background has been Kenmare’s ongoing discussions with the government of Mozambique on an extension of a production royalty agreement, or what is called an implementation agreement, relating to Moma. A 20-year agreement expired before Christmas last year. However, the terms of that accord remain in place until a new one is reached, allowing it to continue to process minerals and export final products. Mr Carvill said Mozambique is looking for more royalties under a new deal. A spokesman for Kenmare declined to comment.

Kenmare said in a trading update in April that it experienced stable market conditions in the first quarter of this year, with encouraging demand for its key product, ilmenite, which is used in the manufacture of everything from paints and plastics to ceramics and textiles.</full_content>

		<full_content>BBNaija star Phyna said Israel DMW tried to shame her and block her after she refused to cut ties with Sheila

She accuses him of being broke, living off Davido’s free handouts, and lacking dignity as an Edo man

Mixed reactions trail her outburst as Nigerians defend Israel, slam Phyna’s entitlement

Big Brother Naija winner, Josephina Otabor, aka Phyna, has reignited a messy online drama with Israel DMW, Davido’s well-known logistics manager, over his comments on her relationship with his estranged wife, Sheila.

The reality star claimed that Israel DMW privately messaged her on WhatsApp, cautioning her against being friends with Sheila.

He allegedly told her that associating with someone like Sheila would block her chances of finding a serious man.

Phyna, unimpressed, refused to cut ties with Sheila and gave Israel a piece of her mind. According to her, he got offended and blocked her on WhatsApp and Instagram.

This pushed her to call him out publicly, branding him a “houseboy” who depends on his boss, Davido, for money and has no monthly salary.

BBnaija star went further to say he’s a disgrace to their home state, Edo, for always “begging.”

She ranted:

“Isreal, you’re not on salary. You're always shouting ‘Oga dash me’. Edo men are not like this&quot;

See the video here:

Netizens react to Phyna's new outburst

Her outburst, however, didn’t sit well with many netizens, who slammed her for insulting someone earning a living and remaining loyal to his hustle.

@classicmann_ said:

“Isreal truly loved her. He just poured out his grief to the wrong person. He thought Sheila was his sister.”

@soma__chi wrote:

“Didn’t she see all that before she married him? All of a sudden she’s now ashamed of him.”

@frankisceo added:

“Imagine person marry this kind woman put for house.”

@henry_aniegboka_ said:

“So you dey call Davido logistics manager houseboy? A lot of Nigerians go line up for that Isreal job.”

@jasmine_precious advised:

“Watch the sermon ‘That Grace Called Favour’ by Apostle Joshua Selman. You can make a living out of honour.”

@change4498 reacted:

“Phyna, there is dignity in labour. If not for BBN, nobody for know you. Stop pressuring young boys.”

@__ray__rayluv said:

“Israel may be extremely petty and all but I know his hustle is far more valuable. I go hold that position tight.”

@jacinta_ezuz commented:

“This comment section is a clear indication of one of our main problems in this country.”

@frankmolokwu added:

“And this one na some people favourite. Lol. Na social media dey cause all these.”

@sirp1021 joked:

“Isreal against Gaza, Isreal against Iran, Isreal against Phyna. Omo Isreal dey try o.”

Phyna drops family's surname

Legit.ng earlier reported that Phyna announced that she will drop her family’s surname.

The BBN Level Up winner had taken to her official X (Twitter) page to explain to the public that she will no longer be going by the name ‘Otabor’ while revealing that she seems to have no family members.

In the viral tweet, the reality star-turned-actress said that nobody seemed to know how she came about, but she was still searching for answers.
