		<full_content>A federal judge blocked portions of a Trump administration order Friday that would have required voters to show proof of citizenship at the voting booth.

In a 44-page memorandum, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper ordered that adding layers of difficulty to the voting process would only harm eligible voters by adding significant barriers before they can cast their ballots.

Casper further noted that Donald Trump’s order was an executive overreach and that the authority to set new election requirements rests with Congress.

“There is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship,” Casper wrote. “The issue here is whether the president can require documentary proof of citizenship where the authority for election requirements is in the hands of Congress, its statutes … do not require it, and the statutorily created [Election Assistance Commission] is required to go through a notice and comment period and consult with the states before implementing any changes to the federal forms for voter registration.”

One of five provisions in the executive order blocked by Casper mandated that the Election Assistance Commission collect and record information on provided documentary proof of citizenship in the national voter registration form. Casper’s ruling also intervened in a White House decree that ordered the secretary of defense to update the absentee application for overseas voters or Americans in the military, which under Trump’s direction would have required such voters to provide proof of citizenship as well as proof of eligibility to vote in their respective states.

“Neither the Constitution nor any statute grants the president the authority to enact” such an order, the judge wrote.

Since Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies have obsessed over contrived claims of voter fraud—a statistical nonissue in U.S. elections. For instance, a statewide audit out of Georgia, the epicenter of Trump’s baseless theory, revealed in September that just 20 noncitizens out of 8.2 million residents existed on the state’s voter roll. Out of those 20, only nine participated in elections, years ago, before ID was required as a part of the voter verification process. The other 11 individuals were registered but never actually voted, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

Critics argue that restrictions on the front end of the electoral process—such as one-day voting and requiring day-of voter ID, which Trump pledged to apply in December—would minimize voter turnout and limit the democracy’s ability to represent its constituents. This would especially be true in high-density areas like the nation’s biggest cities, where those stipulations would significantly drain resources (i.e., boost the number of volunteers required) and require more time to process, potentially leading to delays.</full_content>

		<full_content>AYIA NAPA, Cyprus — Israel has wiped out a third of Iran’s total ballistic missile launchers since Thursday, drastically reducing the risk Iran poses not just to the Jewish state but the world, Israel Defense Forces officials told The Post.

Israel has eliminated 120 Iranian missile launchers since Israel’s Operation Rising Lion began, leaving the Iranian regime with less and less leverage over Israel and its partners as it clings to roughly 66% of the arsenal it had just four days ago, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Monday.

The accomplishment has already had an effect on Tehran’s fight, as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched fewer than 50 missiles at Israel last night — roughly half as many the Iranian regime’s prior barrages, a separate IDF official said.

“The Israeli Air Force struck over 100 military targets in Iran overnight,” the person said. “The strikes focused on central Iran — the main area where missile launchers and ballistic missiles remain.”

Among those targets were more than 20 missiles being prepared for imminent launches at Israel.

“Based on precise intelligence, launch teams that were either operating from command centers or en route to carry out launches against Israel were eliminated during the strikes,” the official said.

The operation’s success was made possible because Israel secured “full operational control over Tehran” in just three days, according to the official — something Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to do over Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, in more than 3.5 years of war.

“Some of (the eliminated 20 missiles) were identified by IAF aircraft just minutes before their planned launch, covered on in plastic,” the official said.

That air superiority is also enabling Israel to continue “targeting Iranian cells in real time as they launch missiles toward the state of Israel and our aircraft,” Defrin said.

“The aerial capabilities we previously saw in Gaza, Lebanon and Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank) are now operational in Iran,” he said.

Israel continued targeting Iranian missiles and missile launchers throughout Monday, with the Israeli Air Force identifying “several trucks containing weapons, including trucks transporting surface-to-air missile launchers, advancing from western Iran toward Tehran, while attempting to escape IDF strikes,” a Israeli military official said.

“The IAF struck the trucks, neutralizing the weapons and launchers,” the person said.

In addition to the Israeli-destroyed Iranian missiles, officials estimate Iran has launched roughly 370 ballistic missiles at Israel in the past days — meaning Tehran could be down to just half to one-third of its total missiles it had before the conflict began

Additionally, Israel targeted more than 20 Iranian military and Quds Force command centers, killing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s head of intelligence, his deputy and the deputy head of the Quds Force’s intelligence organization.

“The Quds Force has been the main conduit for many of the terrorist attacks and assaults against Israel in recent decades,” Defrin said. “Now, the command centers where these attacks were planned have been completely destroyed.”

“The Quds Force is the central terror arm of the Iranian regime. It is responsible for operating Iran’s proxies around Israel’s borders and for distributing weapons and missiles intended for attack the state of Israel,” he added.

However, Iran still managed to strike four different areas in northern and central Israel Sunday night, killing eight civilians and injuring dozens more, Defrin said.

“This is the face of the Iranian terror regime: While we target military and nuclear capabilities intended to destroy the state of Israel, they fire at population centers with the aim of harming civilians,” he said.

“This is precisely why we launched the operation: to eliminate the existential threat posed to the state of Israel: the nuclear and missile threats.”</full_content>

In a surprise attack in the dead of night, Israel took out several members of Iran’s top military chain of command. Explosions rang out in half a dozen Iranian cities, pulverizing apartment blocks and disabling some of the country’s missile batteries, as well as the aboveground portions of Iran’s main enrichment plant at Natanz. Iran reported that 78 people were killed and more than 320 were wounded, the majority of the victims being civilians.

Few people can explain, in plain terms, just how the attack played out on the ground, and what ordinary Iranians make of a night that leveled homes while killing the commanders who ordered crackdowns on protestors within the country just a few years ago. Reza Talebi is a journalist who has lived on every side of this drama. Talebi served as a captain in Iran’s air force, trained as an air traffic controller, and once monitored the very radar screens Israel reportedly attacked. The regime later jailed him for three years, after which he fled to Turkey, earned a Ph.D. in international law, and today reports for BBC International from Leipzig, Germany, where he writes in four languages. Crucially, Talebi still trades messages with friends inside Iran’s air defense network, three of whom died in Friday’s strike on the Tabriz radar station. Talebi walked me through how the events unfolded in a candid phone call. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: By now, everyone has seen the news that Israel pounded Iran with a series of strikes. Could you tell me how exactly it unfolded from your perspective?

Reza Talebi: Around half-past 3 a.m., Israeli aircraft attacked from inside Iranian airspace. You may already know this, but Iran does not have a comprehensive system against missiles and airstrikes. Half their air defenses are from the ’70s, ’60s and older, with radar dating back to the Iran–Iraq war. Iran tried to modernize it, but they couldn’t because of internal conflicts between the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] and the Iranian army.

I know people who were working the Tabriz radars that night. They described to me how it began with Israel jamming the radar systems, first hacking them and then striking them with missiles, making Iran blind in the northwest. Israel then entered Iranian airspace and struck more than 100 targets, like the aboveground nuclear base in Natanz, near Isfahan. Soon after, they received alerts from city centers, including Tehran. What was more shocking was to learn that Israeli Mossad was able to conduct a strike that involved setting up a UAV base from within Tehran to attack the offices and homes of IRGC commanders. They killed nearly 20 people, including scientists. This is a major humiliation for the Iranian government, that Israel proved it can strike from within Iran, including at the center of Iran.

Israel has been talking about bombing Iran for decades now. Why do you think they decided to strike now?

This all came just after Trump gave Iran an ultimatum to concede on their negotiations. This is also the perfect time for Israel when they have the advantage. Israel has already severely weakened proxy groups, like Hezbollah and the Houthis, and now they must believe they can withstand a war on all of those fronts. At the same time, there are whispers about Israeli efforts to support guerrilla rebels within Iran and sow internal conflict.

Iran has already retaliated by launching from its arsenal of 150,000 ballistic missiles, like they had last year, but they are not very accurate because they do not have updated GPS technology. But I think Iran would be better off not continuing to retaliate, given that the international community has already shown that it is willing to tolerate Israel killing 60,000 people in Gaza and starving the survivors, so the international community will not hesitate if Israel and the United States destroys the country. [Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei understands that Iran cannot fight Israel and the United States. But now, they are in a position where they need to apply some pressure back on Israel. Khamenei’s statement shows that he understands this, because it is in my opinion very tempered. But it continues to be a tricky situation for the Iranian government. It’s possible they have nuclear bombs; after all, the Washington Post reported last year that Iran has acquired enough enriched uranium to produce nuclear bombs. And if that is the case, and Iran deploys a nuclear ballistic missile against Israel, after this, Iran will also face global isolation, leading to social and economic collapse. So it’s better in every way for Iran to not retaliate strongly against Israel. Now, they must try and save their people, because the alternative is being destroyed by the United States and Israel.

What are you hearing from people in Iran right now?

We have a broad diversity of people in Iran. Some are praying to God for the downfall of the mullah regime, and though they doubt Israel will help them, at least they could kill him. There are many Iranians who are tired of the government but believe there is no better alternative. There is also the existence of Islamist groups that emerged after Saddam’s war against Iran. There are also many Turks, Kurds, and others, who all have their dense, small communities, who each have their own ideas for how Iran should be led, and feel like the Iranian regime is occupying them and does not invest enough in their communities.

On top of this, there is also a generational gap. There are people my mother’s age who went out for a picnic, believing they’d rather be killed by an Israeli airstrike than live their lives afraid of them. There are also very young Iranians born post–Islamic Revolution who think of this as a golden opportunity for an uprising. But 90 percent of the people I’ve spoken to are afraid of the war because there are so many wars in the Middle East, like in Syria, Afghanistan, and Palestine, and they are afraid their people will also begin to experience the same pain and loss in their country.

Have you heard from anyone who was in close proximity to any of the Israeli airstrikes?

I have a close friend, a lieutenant in the air force, who was on duty in one of the radar stations struck by Israel. He said in a split second, after spotting the Israeli missile, he reacted and somehow survived. I had many friends at that station. Three of them died in that strike.

I also spoke to someone in Tehran who lived in one of the areas struck by Israel. He said he doesn’t believe the official government death toll. He claims that what he saw in Tehran with his own eyes indicates that closer to 150 people died in Tehran alone. He was in shock. He was in Tehran and survived an Iraqi bombardment of the city, and now he says he is seeing the same thing in Tehran. I heard a similar story from a grandma in Tehran. Another friend, a painter, spoke to me for about an hour. For 10 minutes straight, she only cried. She told me she saw situations like this only in the movies.

What do you think is going to be the biggest indication of where things are headed?

Honestly, just like any other person, I want the best for my country. But I’m a pessimist. Our government is not tied to Islamic revelation. It’s a Frankenstein system, and I can’t recognize or understand it anymore. We need to destroy this system. But it needs to be us. Not foreigners. Not colonist countries. It’s difficult to destroy, but it’s our job.

What’s next? I expect Iran to negotiate directly with the United States to resolve this conflict. We just don’t have means to retaliate against Israel, and Israel isn’t interested in diplomatic resolutions. But though Iran is weak, run by a dictator, I don’t believe they want to risk destroying the whole country. Every Iranian wants to protect Iran. We put pressure on our leaders as intellectuals and journalists, men and women, to make good decisions to save our country. But all of us know that if Iran continues to retaliate, Israel will destroy us. Iranians must reform the system from within. That is the only way to create a future for our children.

I think now the Iranian government understands they are under pressure. If they cannot change, the United States will change them, through the hand of Netanyahu. The government understands this is possible. Iran’s best hope is to stop its retaliation and find a diplomatic solution. That is our only chance for peace.</full_content>

Russia Responds to Israel's Strikes on Iran: 'Full-Scale War' Possible

Newsweek ^ | 6/13/2025 | Barney Henderson

Posted on by marcusmaximus

An ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that &quot;a full-scale war&quot; in the Middle East is possible following Israel's airstrikes on Iran.

-snip-

Konstantin Kosachev, vice-speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, made clear that Russia would stand by its ally, Iran.

&quot;Israel's actions cannot be justified from a legal, political, military or moral point of view. The only hope, albeit illusory, of avoiding a full-scale war is a consolidated condemnation of this operation by the international community,&quot; he said, according to Russia's official TASS news agency.

&quot;We can and must hope for another demonstration of restraint from Iran. One must always hope for the best, but naturally there are limits to [Iran's] patience.&quot;

This is a ridiculous article. Israel and Iran have been at war since October 7. The Iranians ordered the Hamas October 7 attacks to derail the Middle East Abraham Accords and instigate a major regional war against Israel by a coalition of Arab states. Iran and it's entire terrorist proxy army network in Gaza, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen (to name a few) has been throwing everything they have at Israel and the US in the region for going on two years. They have lost their war to destroy Israel. If they had any more resources to throw into the fight they would have already done so. If Iran or their proxies execute terrorist attacks on the US they need to be dealt with with overwhelming and disproportionate force. Iran simply cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons and more capable missiles Putin is no doubt unhappy with the recent turn of events as he has been trying to force the US to divert weapons that could be used in the Ukraine into the Middle East and pin the US down in the region but this has backfired and Russia has essentially been kicked out of the Middle East and Israel is dismantling the Iranian military industrial complex that is supporting Russia in Ukraine.

Sabre rattling from a country that doesn’t have much of a military left, after what was supposed to be a 2 week event to take over Ukraine. They were buying Iranian drones and that’s why they are pissed. No more Iranian drones after the Israelis are finished. I have no doubt that Israel could take out Russia if it wanted to. The intelligence the Mossad have is incredible. They got the top Iranian air force commanders in one strike, and when they are done Iran will be an impotent wasteland.

A message to the Iranians: don't count on any Russian military support. How dare you malign Putin's valiant North Korean troops! Putin is probably already preparing to announce another &quot;Special Military Operation.&quot; After all, he still has two-thirds of his long-range cruise missile-capable bombers! And it's not like the Israelis already had any experience in covertly establishing drone-launch sites in enemy territory, is it? Putin would be wise to redeploy all of his aircraft to somewhere where they would be safe from drone-attacks - maybe the Kamchatka Peninsula? Of course, Putin has lost his sole Mediterranean naval base, in Tartus (Syria). But he still commands a significant naval fighting force in the Mediterranean - one which almost rivals its proud Black Sea fleet! Regards,

They won’t attack Israel. At this point, they are no match for Israel and they know it. The Russian military has been reduced to bare bones with their war on Ukraine. They were buying drones from Iran. Mossad’s spies are probably already inside Russia’s military.



To: marcusmaximus

&quot;Israel's actions cannot be justified from a legal, political, military or moral point of view. But invading Ukraine in order to conquer it, under the premise that NATO is a needless deterrent, is.

‘Axis of sitting ducks’: Why Hezbollah cannot afford to defend Iran from Israel’s attacks

The National ^ | June 13, 2025 | Nada Homsi Nada Maucourant Atallah Jamie Prentis

Posted on by sopo

Lebanese Hezbollah’s military defeat after 14 months of conflict with Israel has left it politically and militarily constrained and in no position to support its ally Iran in any future confrontation with Israel, analysts, military experts, and western diplomats told The National.

Israel’s deadly overnight strike on Iran decapitated much of Tehran’s military and nuclear leadership. And a broader regional offensive by Israel over the past two years has severely weakened Iranian proxies across the region, leaving Hezbollah unable to come to its sponsor’s aid.

Under normal circumstances “Hezbollah would definitely respond to the Iranian attack right away,” according to Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut and an expert on Iran’s proxies. “But now I think we are in a different phase and it's a very defeated organisation struggling to rebuild after the hits it has taken.

US nuclear talks 'unjustifiable' after Israeli attack, says Iran's Araghchi LatestUS nuclear talks 'unjustifiable' after Israeli attack, says Iran's Araghchi Read More “Hezbollah is in a difficult position. Iran is in need of support from its closest ally and they are incapable of delivering,” he added.

With Iranian backing, Hezbollah had steadily bolstered its strength over four decades, evolving from a guerrilla movement into a powerful paramilitary force that posed a significant threat to Israel from the southern Lebanese border.

Until recently, the Lebanese group was the most powerful of Iran’s network of regional militias, serving as Tehran’s first line of defence against Israeli threats. Israel has worked to dismantle Iran’s regional proxies – known as the ‘Axis of Resistance’ – “piece by piece”, according to Mr Hage Ali. “The Lebanon part [of the axis] has been diminished significantly,” with Hezbollah suffering a “humiliating defeat”

Israel’s offensive on Hezbollah, which escalated in September 2024, took out the vast majority of the group’s top leadership and destroyed most of its arsenal.

And the group’s ouster from the southernmost part of Lebanon – south of the Litani river – means Hezbollah “no longer has military capabilities along Israel’s borders,” according to military analyst Riad Kahwaji, who is head of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis.

By Israeli and US intelligence estimates, around 70 per cent of Hezbollah’s military capabilities have been destroyed.

Even if Hezbollah were in a position to attack, its main supply route by land through Syria was cut when its ally in neighbouring Syria, Bashar Al Assad, was deposed last December by rebels who Hezbollah themselves had spent years fighting- meaning it would have difficulties replenishing for even the limited stores it has left.

“We’ve reached a place where it’s really inconceivable that we see the organisation respond with force to [the attack on Iran] by the Israelis,” Mr Hage Ali said.

“I’m pretty sure Hezbollah will do nothing in this situation,” said Gen Mounir Shehadeh, who until recently was the Lebanese government's co-ordinator with the UN peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon (Unifil).

Even Hezbollah’s statement condemning the Israeli attacks - which it described as having ”no justification” - lacked its typical vitriolic and violent undertones, warning the Israel’s actions would not go unpunished but little else in terms of threats.

Despite Hezbollah not being in a position to retaliate, a potential intervention which could drag Lebanon into yet another deadly conflict had nonetheless worried western diplomats.

“Hezbollah’s intervention was the question mark that has worried Lebanese in recent days, the concern that a resumption of war could come in connection with what’s happening in Iran. So that’s where our main concern lies,” a western diplomatic source said.

Schools across the south and in the southern suburbs have closed their doors and instructed their students to stay home as a precaution amid fears of escalation.

Lebanese leaders and western diplomats are aware that Lebanon’s relative stability is hanging in the balance. The US and France scrambled to reach a shaky, if uneven, ceasefire in Lebanon. But the ceasefire, and Hezbollah’s defeat, has led to a de facto political reality: Israel can strike at will in Lebanon, but Hezbollah – and Lebanon – would be severely punished for attacking or retaliating.

“The important thing for us is to preserve Lebanon and to ensure that there are no misguided ideas of supporting the war from Lebanon, or any kind of intervention whether it be by Hezbollah or any other groups,” the western diplomat said.

Diplomatic sources previously told The National: “Hezbollah thought it would be like 2006, and that the vague terms of the ceasefire would work in their favour,” the source said, referring to the agreement that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, and which forms the basis of the current truce. “But this is not 2006.”

Lebanon has effectively developed into a new status quo in the days following its November 2024 ceasefire with Israel: Israel continues to occupy five points of Lebanese territory as it bombs parts of Lebanon on a near-daily basis. Hezbollah, militarily depleted and wary of inflicting further war on its population, has largely remained unresponsive.

According to Mr Hage Ali, “Hezbollah can launch an attack for sure, and kill Israelis. But the question is what will happen next for them. They can’t ensure there won’t be any follow up attack [by Isreal]. It’s not an easy one for them.”

Meanwhile, Iran – isolated, bereft of its once ample proxy forces, and scrambling to restructure its command structure after the Israeli attack – has been left to fend for itself against Israel.

“Iran has joined the axis of sitting ducks,” said Mr Hage Ali.

Hard to join the fight when most of your fingers and your tallywhacker were lost when you answered your pager.

There are procedures and mechanisms in place for Israel to take care of any significant Hezbollah activity in Lebanon. When something happens, or is detected, the official Lebanese government attempts to address it. If they cannot resolve the situation, they notify Israel, and Israel takes care of it.

I can sum up the article in three sentences. 1. Hezbollah went to war with Israel.

2. Hezbollah lost their asses in the war, actually literally as their cell phones exploded in a most amusing display and at the same time were decimated militarily.

3. Those not dead do not want to die.

Proxies in the Great Game often only remain your proxies as long as you can supply continuous support. They tend to take a “what have you done for us lately” approach when you can’t give them anything concrete immediately... and Iran can’t deliver anything.

The Houthis have been easier to supply, thopugh. And you’ll note that they haven’t been able to strike back at Israel since the war started?

Neutralizing them seems critical to being able to keep it a more-or-less regional war, hoping for the best.



To: sopo

Pretty sure just about everyone in the area is actually tired of the Houthis and Iran at this point. You’ll notice that there’s been no cries of solidarity with Iran from the usual suspects?

I heard one report that the Lebanese Army is using the IDF to exact revenge on Hezbollah. If Hezbollah challenges them, they call the Israeli Air Force and tell them what to hit.

Time for Lebanese to take up revolution and get rid of the radicals. Beirut was once beautiful. For that matter so was Damascus and Tehran.



To: sopo

Hezbollah barely exists any more. They were crushed by Israel, their remnants run out of Syria by the new regime, and have been neutered in their last refuge and “home” in Lebanon. The past 2 years have been a disaster for Hezbollah.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Iranian state television says the head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is feared dead after an Israeli attack.

The report offered few other details about what happened to Gen. Hossein Salami of the Guard.

The report on air added that one other top Guard officials, as well as two nuclear scientists were also feared dead.

State television also reported the attack set the headquarters of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard ablaze.

“ It’s a decapitation of Irans military leadership.” There will be a revolution there. At one time Israel and Iran were friends. You’re right about the decapitation attack. This will coincide with it.

		<full_content>BBNaija star Phyna said Israel DMW tried to shame her and block her after she refused to cut ties with Sheila

She accuses him of being broke, living off Davido’s free handouts, and lacking dignity as an Edo man

Mixed reactions trail her outburst as Nigerians defend Israel, slam Phyna’s entitlement

Big Brother Naija winner, Josephina Otabor, aka Phyna, has reignited a messy online drama with Israel DMW, Davido’s well-known logistics manager, over his comments on her relationship with his estranged wife, Sheila.

The reality star claimed that Israel DMW privately messaged her on WhatsApp, cautioning her against being friends with Sheila.

He allegedly told her that associating with someone like Sheila would block her chances of finding a serious man.

Phyna, unimpressed, refused to cut ties with Sheila and gave Israel a piece of her mind. According to her, he got offended and blocked her on WhatsApp and Instagram.

This pushed her to call him out publicly, branding him a “houseboy” who depends on his boss, Davido, for money and has no monthly salary.

BBnaija star went further to say he’s a disgrace to their home state, Edo, for always “begging.”

She ranted:

“Isreal, you’re not on salary. You're always shouting ‘Oga dash me’. Edo men are not like this&quot;

See the video here:

Netizens react to Phyna's new outburst

Her outburst, however, didn’t sit well with many netizens, who slammed her for insulting someone earning a living and remaining loyal to his hustle.

@classicmann_ said:

“Isreal truly loved her. He just poured out his grief to the wrong person. He thought Sheila was his sister.”

@soma__chi wrote:

“Didn’t she see all that before she married him? All of a sudden she’s now ashamed of him.”

@frankisceo added:

“Imagine person marry this kind woman put for house.”

@henry_aniegboka_ said:

“So you dey call Davido logistics manager houseboy? A lot of Nigerians go line up for that Isreal job.”

@jasmine_precious advised:

“Watch the sermon ‘That Grace Called Favour’ by Apostle Joshua Selman. You can make a living out of honour.”

@change4498 reacted:

“Phyna, there is dignity in labour. If not for BBN, nobody for know you. Stop pressuring young boys.”

@__ray__rayluv said:

“Israel may be extremely petty and all but I know his hustle is far more valuable. I go hold that position tight.”

@jacinta_ezuz commented:

“This comment section is a clear indication of one of our main problems in this country.”

@frankmolokwu added:

“And this one na some people favourite. Lol. Na social media dey cause all these.”

@sirp1021 joked:

“Isreal against Gaza, Isreal against Iran, Isreal against Phyna. Omo Isreal dey try o.”

Phyna drops family's surname

Legit.ng earlier reported that Phyna announced that she will drop her family’s surname.

The BBN Level Up winner had taken to her official X (Twitter) page to explain to the public that she will no longer be going by the name ‘Otabor’ while revealing that she seems to have no family members.

In the viral tweet, the reality star-turned-actress said that nobody seemed to know how she came about, but she was still searching for answers.
